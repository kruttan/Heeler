Heeler is an **agent console**: a native dashboard of every coding agent running on your machines, sorted by who needs you. Open an Agent to read and steer its live terminal while drafting locally with the full standard iOS keyboard in a native Composer. Send delivers the complete message once; direct control keys, native scrollback, and continuous touch scrolling keep full-screen TUIs usable, all over plain SSH.

## Screenshots

## Features

- **Console** — every Agent across your machines in one status-sorted list
  (who's Blocked comes first), filterable by Host, updating live off herdr's
  event stream.
- **Attach** — read and steer the Agent's real live terminal through
  libghostty, with Metal rendering, native scrollback, momentum touch
  scrolling that also drives full-screen TUIs, and long-press selection. Text
  is composed locally below the terminal, while the tools keyboard's Agent
  controls steer the live TUI directly. Attach and Reattach use herdr takeover
  mode, disconnecting the previous terminal owner when necessary.
- **Attach Links** — silently collect web links to open or copy later.
- **Composer** — draft locally with the full standard iOS keyboard, including
  autocorrect, IME, and system dictation, then Send the complete message once.
  Switch to the tabbed tools keyboard for direct Agent controls, available
  Agent Skills, reusable Snippets that insert into the draft, and terminal
  appearance.
- **Attachment staging** — add a photo from Photos or a file up to 64 MiB from
  Files, stage it onto the Host over SFTP, and insert its path into the local
  draft without submitting it.
- **QR pairing** — add a machine by scanning a Pairing Code from the bundled
  herdr plugin; an Ed25519 Device Key is generated on device, its private key
  stays in the Keychain, and the code pins the host key fingerprint.
- **Agent Notifications** — end-to-end encrypted APNs pushes when an Agent
  goes Blocked or Done, deep-linking into its terminal; the relay sees the
  device token, source IP, request timing, and ciphertext, but cannot read the
  notification.
- **Worktrees** — start an Agent on a clean checkout of a workspace's repo
  with a toggle on the New Agent form.
- **Appearance** — System, Light, or Dark app appearance; 30 curated terminal
  themes with independent Light and Dark Mode slots; bundled JetBrains Mono
  and IBM Plex Mono alongside the system monospace; and pinch-to-zoom text
  size.
- **Jump Host** — reach machines that are not directly routable through an
  SSH jump, with keys verified independently at both hops.

## How it connects

The app speaks herdr's JSON API (newline-delimited JSON over a Unix socket) through SSH:

- **RPC + events**: an OpenSSH direct-streamlocal channel straight onto `herdr.sock` per request, plus one long-lived channel for `events.subscribe`.
- **Interactive terminal + Composer**: the Agent detail screen requests an SSH PTY and execs `herdr agent attach <pane> --takeover` on it, then renders the live terminal through a host-managed libghostty-spm session with Metal output, persistent appearance-aware themes, long-press text selection, and app-routed touch scrolling for both local scrollback and remote TUIs. Drafting stays local in the Composer until Send issues one `agent.prompt` RPC; only the tools keyboard's explicit Agent controls go directly through the PTY.

No herdr server changes and no extra packages required: SSH access plus a running herdr server is the whole prerequisite. The Host's SSH server does have to permit stream-local forwarding, which is the OpenSSH default; onboarding says so when it is turned off.

Hosts that are not directly reachable can be placed behind an SSH Jump Host.
The recommended deployment keeps the reverse-forwarded port on the VPS
loopback interface instead of publishing the Mac's SSH port.

## Adding a machine: install the plugin, scan the code

The repo ships a [herdr plugin](plugin/README.md) that pairs the app with a
machine by QR code and delivers Agent Notifications over APNs. On the machine
running herdr (Node >= 20, herdr >= 0.7.5, OpenSSH server enabled — on macOS
that is **System Settings > General > Sharing > Remote Login**):

```bash
herdr plugin install ZingerLittleBee/Heeler/plugin --ref main --yes
herdr plugin action invoke heeler.pair
```

The `pair` action opens a popup with a Pairing Code QR; scan it with the app
and the machine is added as a Host — addresses, host key fingerprint, and SSH
key enrollment are all handled by the code, nothing to type. The same plugin
pushes encrypted Blocked/Done notifications to the app once you enable Agent
Notifications for the Host in the app's settings; the relay sees the device
token, source IP, request timing, and ciphertext, but cannot read the
notification (see [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)).

## Stack

- SwiftUI, iOS 18+, iPhone today; iPad support is planned for a later release
- The repository-local `Packages/HeelerSSH` (libssh2 + OpenSSL) for SSH
- [libghostty-spm](https://github.com/lakr233/libghostty-spm) for terminal emulation and Metal rendering

See `docs/adr/` for why these choices were made (the transport story in particular is not obvious).

## Status

Pre-alpha. Personal-use first; not affiliated with the herdr project.
